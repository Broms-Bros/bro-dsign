# Social Media Icons as a SketchApp Library
A [SketchApp](https://www.sketch.com/) library with all the graphical assets for social media outlets.
The library is built so you as a SketchApp user, graphical designer &/or UX/UI designer easily can extend your ongoing graphical work with the power of having centralization in your modifications and changes. Also, so we as a community can use the power of open-source, for instance if a social media vendor changes brand colors, logo symbols etc. help each other to change it easily.
